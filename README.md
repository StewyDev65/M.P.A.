## üìã Prerequisites

- [Java 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [JavaFX SDK](https://openjfx.io/)
- **Minecraft Textures** (not included, must be extracted separately for legal reasons)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/minecraft-pixel-art-creator.git
   cd minecraft-pixel-art-creator
   ```

2. Extract Minecraft block textures from your legal copy of Minecraft
    - Navigate to your Minecraft installation
    - Find the JAR file for your Minecraft version (e.g., `.minecraft/versions/1.20.1/1.20.1.jar`)
    - Extract the `assets/minecraft/textures/block` directory

3. Build the application
   ```bash
   # Using Maven
   mvn clean package
   
   # OR using Gradle
   gradle build
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.swing -jar target/minecraft-pixel-art-creator.jar
   ```

## üöÄ Using the App

### Initial Setup

1. **First Launch**: Open the application
2. **Load Block Textures**: Go to `File ‚Üí Load Block Textures` and select your directory of extracted Minecraft block textures
3. **Open an Image**: Go to `File ‚Üí Open Image` to select an image to convert

### Converting Images

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="60%">
      <h4>Step 1: Adjust Settings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a conversion algorithm from the dropdown menu</li>
        <li>Adjust block variety (1-250) to control the diversity of blocks</li>
        <li>Set color sensitivity (1-100%) to fine-tune color matching</li>
        <li>Configure resolution to determine creation size</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 2: Processing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable "Live Preview" for real-time updates as you adjust settings</li>
        <li>Click "Process Image" to generate the final preview</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Step 3: Exporting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Click "Export Schematic" to save as Minecraft commands</li>
        <li>Choose from multiple export formats</li>
        <li>Select coordinate style (relative/absolute)</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Export Options

The app offers multiple ways to export your creations:

| Export Format | Description | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Individual Commands | A text file with separate setblock/fill commands | For manual pasting into chat/command blocks |
| One Command Block | A single command that spawns command block minecarts | For "one-click" installation in creative mode |
| Function File | `.mcfunction` file compatible with Minecraft's function system | For use in datapacks or function folders |
| Data Pack | Complete datapack with horizontal and vertical placement functions | Most user-friendly option for survival worlds |

Example of generated commands:
```minecraft
# Minecraft Pixel Art Commands
# Generated by Minecraft Pixel Art Creator
# Dimensions: 64x64

fill ~0 ~0 ~0 ~3 ~0 ~0 minecraft:grass_block
setblock ~4 ~0 ~0 minecraft:oak_log
fill ~5 ~0 ~0 ~7 ~0 ~0 minecraft:oak_planks
# ... more commands ...
```

### Block Management

- **Block Library Editor**: Access via `Options ‚Üí Block Library Editor`
    - Enable/disable specific blocks
    - Adjust color properties
    - Set block priorities

- **Block ID Mappings**: Access via `Options ‚Üí Block ID Mappings`
    - Import custom mappings
    - Export current mappings
    - Update block repository

## üß† Conversion Algorithms

| Algorithm | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Average Color | Simple color matching | Quick conversions |
| Color Matching | Precise color matching | Detailed art |
| Dithering | Adds texture for gradients | Smooth transitions |
| K-Means Clustering | Groups similar colors | Complex images |
| Edge Preservation | Maintains sharp details | Images with clear edges |
| Full Hybrid | Combines multiple techniques | Balanced results |
| Average with Dithering | Balanced approach | Most images |

## üí¨ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Why do I need to provide my own textures?</b></summary>
Due to Mojang's licensing terms, we cannot distribute Minecraft textures with this application. You must extract them from your legitimate copy of Minecraft.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What's the recommended image size?</b></summary>
For best results, start with images between 512x512 and 1024x1024 pixels. The application will resize based on your resolution setting.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use this in survival mode?</b></summary>
Yes! The Data Pack export option creates functions that can be run in survival mode (though you'll need the blocks in your inventory).
